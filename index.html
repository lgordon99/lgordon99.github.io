    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I’m Lucia, and I have been a PhD student in Computer Science at
      <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu">Harvard’s School for Engineering and Applied Sciences</a> since Fall 2022.
      I work as a researcher in Milind Tambe’s <a href="https://teamcore.seas.harvard.edu">Teamcore</a> group.
      My undergraduate background is in physics and mathematics, but my graduate research interests lie in machine
      learning methods and applications to conservation, climate change, and sustainability. I’m currently working on the
      PAWS project to leverage AI in patrol planning to combat wildlife poaching.</p>
